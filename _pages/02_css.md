Excuse me. Hello, Jennifer. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. You too. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.

Hi, Marty. Right, I got it. What? Yeah, exactly. I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future-

In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Marty, are you alright? Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties?
