What's the meaning of this. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. You'll find out. And where's my reports? I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.

What's going on? Where have you been all week? Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Ah, where're my pants? My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her-

Never mind that now, never mind that now. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. McFly.
