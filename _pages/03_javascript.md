Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein.

whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Did you hurt your head? Marty, you made it.

Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. Calvin. He's a very strange young man. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Just finishing up the second coat now.
