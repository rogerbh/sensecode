So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. I guarantee it. Alright, take it up, go. Doc. The hell you doing to my car?

Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody.
