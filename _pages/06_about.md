##### Skills/Languages
Nowadays, I work mainly with __JavaScript__, __CSS__ _(SASS/LESS)_ and __HTML__. Also, I really enjoy working with __CSS Animations__ and __SVG__.

##### Learning/Trying
Currently studying and doing some works with the hotest JS libraries/frameworks avaialble. __React__ and __VueJs__ are my favourites for now.
It feels really nice working with these amazing tools after using only Vanilla JS and jQuery for a while.

Lately, I've been constantly reading/studying about __UX design__ and all its variants.

[//]: # I'm at the beginning of reading/studying about development with __Firebase__ _(Firestore)_ and __MongoDB__.

[//]: # My main goal with this website is to learn much more about the whole JS world. But also, to teach things I already know.
[//]: # Here, I hope I'll be experimenting all sorts of resources for front end development and designing.
