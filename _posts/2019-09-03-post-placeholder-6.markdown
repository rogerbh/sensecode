Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. What's that thing he's on? It's my dad.

Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. I can't play. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Uh, Doc. George.

Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. You'll find out. Get your meat hooks off of me. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater.
