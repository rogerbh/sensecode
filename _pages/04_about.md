#### Yep! css used to be much better back then.

I work mainly with html, css and js.

i'm Currently studying and doing some works with the hotest JS frameworks avaialble, like React and VueJs. Besides other cool stuff like Ionic and React Native.

What moves me at this area is the possibility of creating beautiful and inspiring things with some lines of code.
