So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- You're gonna be in the car with her. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.

Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine. Uh? Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him.
