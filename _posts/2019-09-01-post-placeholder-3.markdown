Don't tell me anything. What? A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. Now Biff, don't con me. You do?

Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Stop it. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.

Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Uh, coast guard. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein.
