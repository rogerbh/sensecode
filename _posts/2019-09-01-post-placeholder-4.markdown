Back to the future. George. George. I don't wanna see you in here again. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Perfect, just perfect.

Well, I figured, what the hell. Children. What? Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon.

Don't tell me anything. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. Stop it. Doc. Why am I always the last one to know about these things.
