Right. Yeah. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Because, you might regret it later in life.

Next, please. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? C'mon. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?
