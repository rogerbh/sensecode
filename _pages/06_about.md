Nowadays, I work mainly with __JavaScript__, __CSS__ _(SASS/LESS)_ and __HTML__. Also, I really enjoy working with __CSS Animations__ and __SVG__.

Currently studying and doing some works with the hotest JS frameworks avaialble. __React__ and __VueJs__ are my favourites for now.
It feels really nice working with these amazing frameworks after using Vanilla JS and jQuery for a while.

I'm at the beginning of reading/studying about development with __Firebase__ and __MongoDB__.

What moves me at this area is the possibility of __creating beautiful and inspiring things with some lines of code__.

My main goal with this website is to learn much more about about the whole JS world. But also, to teach things I already know.
Here, I hope I'll be experimenting all sorts of resources for front end development and designing.
